# Sheet Music Reader 
## Brief Description

Our project aims at creating a pipepline which will be able to read sheet music from music tabs via a camera/photo/image. It will also play the music notes after they are detected by the algorithm.

## Setup and Installation
- Change directory to `src` folder.
  Run the notebook named `sheetMusic.ipynb`

- All the test cases we had used are included in the folder `data/input` with their corresponding outputs in `data/output`

  No additional test case is to be downloaded.

- To Give New Input Test Cases

  - Add the image to the `data/input` folder
  - Change the fileName in the cell under the Input Section in the Notebook

## Sample outputs

Give sample outputs - both success and failure cases for the techniquie you have used.
